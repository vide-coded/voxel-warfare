Sprint drains 20 stamina/sec, regens 15/sec when not sprinting. Walk speed: 5 units/sec, Sprint: 8 units/sec, Jump force: 10 units, Gravity: -30 units/sec²."

Implemented ranged combat with projectile physics (bullet drop, 12 round clip, 60 reserve ammo, 1.5s reload time). Updated HUD to display current weapon, ammo counter, and reloading status. Attack cooldown system prevents spam clicking. WeaponController component manages all combat logic in game loop. Console logs for hit confirmation (enemies will be added in Task 2.2)."

      "notes": "✅ Complete enemy AI system implemented: Created enemy types (Zombie, Bandit) with unique stats (health, speed, damage, ranges). Built full AI state machine with 6 states: IDLE → PATROL → ALERT → CHASE → ATTACK → FLEE. Patrol behavior: enemies walk between waypoints in a circle around spawn. Alert state: enemy notices player within detection range (15m zombies, 20m bandits). Chase behavior: pathfinding directly toward player with line-of-sight tracking. Attack behavior: melee (2m range, 15 dmg) or ranged (10m range, 10 dmg) with cooldown system. Flee behavior: when health < 20%, run away at 1.5x speed. Death & respawn: enemies die, respawn after 30 seconds. Combat integration: both melee (raycast) and ranged (projectile) weapons now detect and damage enemies. Visual feedback: floating health bars above enemies, state indicators (⚠️ alert, 👁️ chase, ⚔️ attack, 💨 flee), voxel-style character models with different colors per type. Enemy component uses R3F + Rapier physics with kinematic bodies. Spawned 5 enemies (3 zombies, 2 bandits) in a circle around player spawn. System maintains 60 FPS with all enemies active. Damage calculation includes defense reduction formula. AI updates every frame with delta time for smooth movement."
